"""
Book Engine
===========

Independent runtime engine that compiles user inputs (chat history, notebooks,
knowledge bases, intent) into structured, block-based, interactive "living
books". Sits parallel to ``ChatOrchestrator`` and reuses the existing
``ToolRegistry`` / ``CapabilityRegistry`` / ``StreamBus`` plumbing.
