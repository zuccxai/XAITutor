TeX Chunker - LaTeX text chunking tool

Features:
1. Intelligent chunking of LaTeX content (by section or token count)
2. Token estimation (based on GPT tokenizer)
3. Maintain context coherence (overlap between chunks)

\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction section with some content that is moderately long.
It contains multiple paragraphs and discusses the background of the research.

The problem we are addressing is important and has wide applications.

\section{Related Work}
Previous work has explored various approaches to this problem.
Some researchers have used method A, while others prefer method B.

Recent advances in deep learning have opened new possibilities.

\subsection{Deep Learning Approaches}
Neural networks have shown promising results in many tasks.
Convolutional networks are particularly effective for image processing.

\section{Methodology}
Our approach combines the best aspects of previous methods.
We propose a novel architecture that addresses the key limitations.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
The model consists of three main components: encoder, processor, and decoder.
Each component is carefully designed to handle specific aspects of the task.

\section{Experiments}
We conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
